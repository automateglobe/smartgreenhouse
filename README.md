# smartgreenhouse
A fully automated AI-powered greenhouse control system using the Elecrow ESP32-S3 Advance 7" display, designed to monitor and manage environmental conditions with smart logic, touchscreen UI, and future LoRa integration.

ESP32-S3 AI Greenhouse Automation System

This repository hosts the source code and resources for an ongoing smart greenhouse automation project powered by the Elecrow ESP32-S3 Advance 7" display. The system is designed to monitor and control various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH, and water levels, while managing actuators like pumps, misters, fans, and lights using an intuitive touchscreen UI and AI-based decision logic.

🌱 Project Status: Currently in development — we're in the process of constructing the greenhouse complex and finalizing the control logic and hardware setup.

📁 Code Availability: All source code, schematics, and documentation will be published here upon project completion, so stay tuned!
